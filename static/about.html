			Hi I'm Heidi. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and I grew up in 
			Cupertino, California.
			<p>
			I am currently completing my <a href="http://mscs.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">
			Master's in Computer Science</a> at 
			<a href="http://stanford.edu/" target="_blank">Stanford 
			University</a>, concentrating in Human Computer Interaction. 
			I graduated from 
			<a href="http://www.wellesley.edu/" target="_blank">Wellesley College</a> with a major in 
			<a href="http://new.wellesley.edu/cs" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and a minor in 
			<a href="http://new.wellesley.edu/economics" target="_blank">Economics</a>.
			<p>
			My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Science, Art/Design,
			Social Behavior, and Education. I want to
			make our interactions with the digital world flow more seamlessly into 
			everyday life, and I am interested in building tools to improve collaboration, 
			amplify creativity, and enhance education.
			<p>
			In my free time, I love dancing, cooking, hiking, and enjoying coffee with friends.
